            <h2>Greenhouse gas emissions</h2>
            <p>Human-caused greenhouse gas emissions are the primary driver of climate change. Activities such as burning fossil fuels for energy and transportation, industrial production, and intensive agriculture release large quantities of carbon dioxide, methane, and other gases into the atmosphere. These gases trap heat from the sun, creating a warming effect known as the greenhouse effect. As emissions continue to rise, global temperatures increase, leading to more frequent and severe weather events, rising sea levels, and long-term environmental changes.</p>

            <h2>Deforestation</h2>
            <p>Deforestation significantly contributes to climate change by reducing the Earth’s ability to absorb carbon dioxide (CO₂) from the atmosphere. Forests act as carbon sinks, meaning they capture and store large amounts of CO₂, which help regulate climate. When trees are cut down or burned, not only is this carbon-absorbing capacity lost, but the carbon stored in the trees is released back into the air, increasing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere. This process disrupts ecosystems, contributes to global warming, and reduces biodiversity.</p>

            <h2>Public transport</h2>
            <p>Public transport is an effective measure to mitigate emissions because it reduces greenhouse gas emissions per passenger by ~66% per kilometer compared to private vehicles, according to the World Resources Institute. By shifting more trips from private cars to public transit, cities can lower overall fossil fuel consumption, reduce traffic congestion, and improve air quality especially in low-income communities disproportionately affected by pollution. Additionally, expanding and electrifying public transport fleets such as buses powered by renewable energy further decreases carbon footprints and supports equitable, sustainable urban development. </p>

            <h2>Nuclear power - governmental actions</h2>
            <p>Nuclear energy protects air quality by producing massive amounts of carbon-free electricity. While it has been effectively demonised in some countries due to events such as Chernobyl and Fukushima, nuclear power only produces steam and a minute amount of waste products. Producing 1 terawatt of energy from coal produces 0.9 to 1 million tonnes of CO₂, whereas nuclear power plants emit no carbon, just tiny amounts of nuclear waste, some of which can be reprocessed as fuel, the rest can be stored safely in near-surface dry cask storage.* </p>
            <h6>High-level nuclear waste makes up just 0.25% of the total nuclear waste pool on earth, typically disposed of in stable geological formations, several hundred meters below the surface. <a href=https://decarbonization.visualcapitalist.com/visualizing-all-the-nuclear-waste-in-the-world>Source</a> </h6>

            <h2>Natural climate variability hypothesis </h2>
            <p>Some theories claim that fluctuations in the sun's energy output have driven climate change over the past century. However, NASA's solar irradiance data dating back to 1880 clearly show a slight decline in solar activity during the period when global temperatures have risen sharply. This means the sun has actually been emitting less energy while Earth's climate warms, directly contradicting the idea that solar variability is responsible for recent warming. Scientific consensus confirms that natural solar changes cannot explain the observed temperature trends, reinforcing that human activities are the dominant factor behind modern climate change.</p>
