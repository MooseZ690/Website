            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>This website was developed as part of my Year 11 Digital Technology (11DTP) project, with the aim of informing and educating users about climate change. It provides a clear overview of the scientifically established causes of climate change, explores a range of proposed theories — both credible and debunked — and outlines practical actions individuals can take to make a positive impact. The project is designed to present accurate, accessible information and to encourage thoughtful engagement with one of the most pressing global issues of our time.</p>
