            <h2>Greenhouse gas emissions</h2>
            <p>Human-caused greenhouse gas emissions are the primary driver of climate change. Activities such as burning fossil fuels for energy and transportation, industrial production, and intensive agriculture release large quantities of carbon dioxide, methane, and other gases into the atmosphere. These gases trap heat from the sun, creating a warming effect known as the greenhouse effect. As emissions continue to rise, global temperatures increase, leading to more frequent and severe weather events, rising sea levels, and long-term environmental changes.</p>

            <h2>Deforestation</h2>
            <p>Deforestation significantly contributes to climate change by reducing the Earth’s ability to absorb carbon dioxide (CO₂) from the atmosphere. Forests act as carbon sinks, meaning they capture and store large amounts of CO₂, which help regulate climate. When trees are cut down or burned, not only is this carbon-absorbing capacity lost, but the carbon stored in the trees is released back into the air, increasing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere. This process disrupts ecosystems, contributes to global warming, and reduces biodiversity.</p>

            <h2>Public transport</h2>
            <p>Public transport is an effective measure to mitigate emissions because it reduces greenhouse gas emissions per passenger by ~66% per kilometer compared to private vehicles, according to the World Resources Institute. By shifting more trips from private cars to public transit, cities can lower overall fossil fuel consumption, reduce traffic congestion, and improve air quality especially in low-income communities disproportionately affected by pollution. Additionally, expanding and electrifying public transport fleets such as buses powered by renewable energy further decreases carbon footprints and supports equitable, sustainable urban development. </p>

            <h2>Nuclear power - governmental actions</h2>
            <p>Nuclear energy protects air quality by producing massive amounts of carbon-free electricity. While it has been effectively demonised in some countries due to events such as Chernobyl and Fukushima, nuclear power only produces steam and a minute amount of waste products. Producing 1 terawatt of energy from coal produces 0.9 to 1 million tonnes of CO₂, whereas nuclear power plants emit no carbon, just tiny amounts of nuclear waste, some of which can be reprocessed as fuel, the rest can be stored safely in near-surface dry cask storage.* </p>
            <h6>High-level nuclear waste makes up just 0.25% of the total nuclear waste pool on earth, typically disposed of in stable geological formations, several hundred meters below the surface. <a href=https://decarbonization.visualcapitalist.com/visualizing-all-the-nuclear-waste-in-the-world>Source</a> </h6>

            <h2>Natural climate variability hypothesis </h2>
            <p>Some theories claim that fluctuations in the sun's energy output have driven climate change over the past century. However, NASA's solar irradiance data dating back to 1880 clearly shows a slight decline in solar activity during the period when global temperatures have risen sharply. This means the sun has actually been emitting less energy while Earth's climate warms, directly contradicting the idea that solar variability is responsible for recent warming. Scientific consensus confirms that natural solar changes cannot explain the observed temperature trends, reinforcing that human activities are the dominant factor behind modern climate change.</p>

            <h2>Volcanic activity causing climatic variation</h2>
            <p>Some people say that volcanic eruptions cause most of the Earth's warming by releasing gases and ash into the air. While volcanoes do release carbon dioxide, their total emissions are much smaller than human activities like burning fossil fuels. In fact, large volcanic eruptions often cool the Earth temporarily by blocking sunlight with ash clouds. Scientists agree that volcanoes cannot explain the long-term rise in global temperatures. Human-caused greenhouse gas emissions remain the main driver of climate change.</p>

            <h2>Inundation</h2>
            <p>Increased global temperatures contribute significantly to the accelerated melting of polar ice sheets and mountain glaciers around the world. This process introduces vast amounts of pre iously frozen freshwater into the oceans, raising global sea levels. Since pre-industrial times, global sea levels have risen by approximately 22 centimeters, a trend that continues to accelerate with ongoing climate change. These rising sea levels pose a particularly severe threat to small island nations and coastal regions with low elevations AMSL. Such areas are at increased risk of inundation, which can result in the loss of habitable land, displacement of communities, degradation of freshwater resources due to saltwater intrusion, and damage to critical infrastructure. In extreme cases, entire islands could become uninhabitable or disappear altogether, creating climate refugees and placing additional stress on neighboring regions and global humanitarian aid systems.</p>

            <h2>Extinction of species</h2>
            <p>Climate change is making it hard for many animals and plants to survive. For example, polar bears are losing sea ice, their main home, and have trouble finding food. Coral reefs, like the Great Barrier Reef, are bleaching and dying because the ocean is getting too warm. Frogs in Central America are disappearing as their wet habitats dry up. Some birds and butterflies are moving to cooler places, but many cannot move fast enough. If the climate keeps changing, more species could disappear forever, which harms nature and people who depend on it. </p>
